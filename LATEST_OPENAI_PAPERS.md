### OpenAI o1 Series (September 2024)
- **Title**: "OpenAI o1 System Card"
- **Date**: September 12, 2024
- **Type**: System Card
- **Link**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16720
- **Authors**: OpenAI
- **Abstract**: The o1 model series is trained with large-scale reinforcement learning to reason using chain of thought, leading to state-of-the-art performance on certain benchmarks for risks such as generating illicit advice, choosing stereotyped responses, and succumbing to known jailbreaks.

### GPT-4o System Card (October 2024)
- **Title**: "GPT-4o System Card"
- **Date**: October 2024
- **Type**: System Card
- **Link**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21276
- **Authors**: OpenAI et al. (417 total authors)
- **Abstract**: GPT-4o is an autoregressive omni model that accepts text, audio, image, and video inputs and generates text, audio, and image outputs. It responds to audio inputs in as little as 232 milliseconds, matches GPT-4 Turbo performance on English text and coding tasks, is 50% cheaper, and has better vision and audio understanding.
